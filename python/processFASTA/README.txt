The two input files are in the /inputs folder and should stay there. Scripts are 
stored in and should be run out of the /scripts folder. Outputs will be sent to their 
designated folders. The motif_counts folder contains intermediates that I 
generate for the topmotifs section.

#-------------------------------------------

There are two options to running scripts. 

First: one at a time in the following
order:

1. copyExomes.sh
-goal: Move the assigned exomes from /wk4_exomes to /exomes in accordance 
with clinical_data.txt

2. createCrisprReady.sh
-goal: Generate exome_topmotifs.fasta files from exome files in /exomes in accordance
with motif_lists.txt

3. identifyCrisprSite.sh
-goal: Generate exome_precrispr.fasta files from exome_topmotifs.fasta files

4. editGenome.sh
-goal: Generate exome_postcrispr.fasta files from exome_precrispr.fasta files

5. summary.py
-goal: Use the exome_precrispr.fasta and the clinical_data.txt to generate summary.txt

#-------------------------------------------

Second: Run the Master.sh, which runs the scripts in order.

Most output files are generated by pushing lines of code to txt files, so please make sure 
the output folders start out empty so there is no overlap.
