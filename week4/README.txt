RBIF-100 Week 4 Assignment 

The two input files are in the /inputs folder and should stay there. Scripts are 
stored in and should be run out of the /scripts folder. Outputs will be sent to their 
designated folders. The motif_counts folder contains intermediates that I 
generate for the topmotifs section.

The code should be sufficiently documented - some comments act as togglable
diagnostic code for echoing intermediates and some 
reflect thought processes for reference. 

#-------------------------------------------

There are two options to running my scripts. 

First: You can run them one at a time in the following
order (same as indicated in the assignment):

1. copyExomes.sh
-goal: Move the assigned exomes from /wk4_exomes to /exomes in accordance 
with clinical_data.txt

2. createCrisprReady.sh
-goal: Generate exome_topmotifs.fasta files from exome files in /exomes in accordance
with motif_lists.txt

3. identifyCrisprSite.sh
-goal: Generate exome_precrispr.fasta files from exome_topmotifs.fasta files

4. editGenome.sh
-goal: Generate exome_postcrispr.fasta files from exome_precrispr.fasta files

5. summary.py
-goal: Use the exome_precrispr.fasta and the clinical_data.txt to generate summary.txt

#-------------------------------------------

Or Second: Run the asgnWK4_Master.sh, which runs the scripts in order.

Most output files are generated by pushing lines of code to txt files, so please make sure 
the output folders start out empty so there is no overlap. You can use the cleanup.sh script
to rm -f everything in the output folders and the summary.txt in the week4 directory. 

Best,

Excel
